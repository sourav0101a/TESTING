In this issue we are having 2 severe challenge due to which it’s very difficult to provide the quick fix.
The very most challenge here is,  we can’t recreate it in the lower environment, as there is no connection setup for account creation in lower org. We need to analyse the code through previously downloaded logs, which make it anonymous. 

Initially, I went through the code and the logs. I saw there were few processes, in the lead conversion, which were running recursively. I tried to stop this recursion, but stopping this extra trigger run impacted one of the  “quote expiration” functionality, which the testing team encountered in UAT. So we can’t stop the recursion of these trigger directly, as there are other processes which are dependent here. 

Since there is no setup in lower env, we need to promote our changes in UAT to understand the functionality by adding some debug logs.
The other challenge here is test classes are not written properly. There are still a lot of  tech debt remaining, few of them I cleared which required for this lead conversion process, but still there are many left.
Also, this class referred in multiple flows such as in genesis process, lead conversion processes, quote conversion processes and there are Ecomm processes too, due to which it’s test class become highly unstable to deploy, if any of the business logic fail.
