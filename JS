We are facing significant challenges with the lead conversion process due to a few critical issues:
Environment Limitations: We are unable to replicate the issue in our lower environment due to the lack of account creation setup. As a result, we are limited to analyzing anonymized logs from previous attempts.

Recursive Trigger Issues: We’ve observed recursive behavior in the lead conversion triggers, which is causing problems. While we tried to address this by stopping the recursion, it inadvertently affected the "quote expiration" functionality, as noted during UAT. Directly stopping these triggers isn’t a viable solution due to their dependencies with other processes.

Given the lack of setup in the lower environment, we need to make adjustments and add debug logs in UAT to understand the functionality better. Additionally, the test classes for these processes are incomplete and unstable. Although we have addressed some technical debt related to lead conversion, several issues remain. These test classes are crucial for various processes, including Genesis, lead conversion, quote conversion, and Ecomm, making them highly sensitive to changes and challenging to deploy.
