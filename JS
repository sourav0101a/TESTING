We are facing significant challenges with the lead conversion process due to a few critical issues:
Environment Limitations: We are unable to replicate the issue in our lower environment due to the lack of account creation setup. As a result, we are limited to analyzing anonymized logs from previous attempts.

Recursive Trigger Issues: We’ve observed recursive behavior in the lead conversion triggers, which is causing problems. While we tried to address this by stopping the recursion, it inadvertently affected the "quote expiration" functionality, as noted during UAT. Directly stopping these triggers isn’t a viable solution due to their dependencies with other processes.

Testing and Debugging: Given the constraints of our lower environment, we need to enhance our debugging efforts in UAT. Additionally, the test classes associated with these processes are incomplete and unstable. Although we’ve resolved some of the technical debt related to lead conversion, significant issues remain. The test classes impact several processes, including Genesis, lead conversion, quote conversion, and Ecomm, making them delicate and challenging to deploy.
