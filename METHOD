AC1: CMFX Sales Ops users can create SAM campaigns

GIVEN THAT I am a CMFX - Sales Ops and Enablement profile user

WHEN I create a new sales campaign (go to Campaigns and click 'New')

THEN the campaign does not default to Helpdesk

SO THAT I am able to create campaigns, in the same way as a GBO profile user, that shows 'Other Information, Marketing Information, Campaign Hierarchy sections

 

AC2: Change existing CMFX (Helpdesk) campaigns to SAM campaigns

GIVEN THAT I am any SF user 

WHEN I view the following existing campaigns (see table below)

THEN the campaigns are SAM (NOT Helpdesk) campaigns

SO THAT I am able to see the 'Other Information, Marketing Information, Campaign Hierarchy sections
